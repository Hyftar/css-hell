          The mechanics of the puzzles are simple: for each peg, there is a
          hole, and each peg must overlap with its corresponding hole. To
          accomplish this, you will add CSS properties to certain divs. All divs
          have a limit on the number of properties that can be added (usually
          just one or two), and some are "locked" (no properties can be added).
          In general, <i>any</i> CSS property is allowed, with a few exceptions
          that you may stumble across. For that reason, I would recommend
          keeping the{" "}
